								<p>Hi! Thank you for visiting my page. <br>
<p></p>
									I was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Spanish was the only language I knew until my family and I moved to Phoenix, Arizona when I was 14 years old. Funny how quickly you can learn a new language when you really have to. 
									After high school, I enrolled in Arizona State University, and graduated with a bachelors in Justice Studies. <br></br>
																
									After college, I worked as a county and then a federal probation officer. Looking back, I spent a lot of time fixing co-workers' computer problems or creating spreadsheets and charts for the management team. My passion for the criminal system faded 
									after a few years, and I took a leap and quit to start a business with my husband. 
									During that time I also had various other jobs doing sales for tech companies, had my daughter, and moved thru the country a few times before settling in Austin. 
									
									At some point I realized I wanted to establish a career, but I also wanted a challenge, and to learn something new. So here I am. Coding bootcamp. Looking forward to the next chapter.
